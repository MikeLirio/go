# README - GO - [Golang.org](GO_Official)

This is my personal workspace of GO. I will push everything related with GO that I made here.

*This README is written with [Typora][] software.*

## Repository Three

* Repositories created based on video [seeing the this video from YouTube][YTB_01]. Quite basic, but cool ^^
  Click on the repos to go the *go* file.
  * [**hello_there**][GH_hello]: classic hello world .
  * [**summary**][GH_s1]: it contains basic types, loops, maps, arrays, list and conditionals
  * [**summary_advanced**][GH_s2]: it contains pointers, structs and error handling

## Notes

* All projects are located in the same folder called **workspace**. Because of that, all project you do should go inside of the folder `src`.  The final three should something similar to this:

  ```paths
  gopath/user/go #This can be complete customized
  	|- bin
          ........
  		list_of_compiled_executables.exe
  		........
  	|- src
  		|-project1
  		|-project2
          |-........
  		|-projectN
  	|- pkg
  		|-...........
          |-folder_packages_downloaded
          |-...........
  ```

* All application that you want to be executed *must have a package call* ***main***.

* Is **important** to take a look on the packages from [golang webpage][GO_pkg].

* ***GO DOES NOT HAVE EXEPTIONS !!!!***

* ***GO USE POINTERS !!! :blue_heart:***

## Commands

```bash
# Execute the file indicated
go run {file.go}

# install the project on bin folden
go install 
```

## POWERSHELL useful code

To be able to have your own scripts on PowerShell you'll have to do 2 things:

* Create the next file and insert your scripts: `C:\Users\micha\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`
* Write in the console the next command to allow PowerShell to execute scripts:
   `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted`

```powershell
